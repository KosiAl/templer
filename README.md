### JSON Conversion
Templer allows you to convert Excel tables and other web tables into JSON code seamlessly. Simply paste your Excel data, hit the convert button, and receive your JSON code instantly.

### Code Generation
Templer doesn't just convert data; it also generates codes for tables. With Angular options, you can inspect and copy HTML, CSS, and TypeScript code. File downloads are also supported for your convenience.

### User Interface Customization
You can adjust the look and feel of your workspace by selecting from six primary colors and toggling between dark and light themes.

### Angular Material Support
Enhance your coding experience with the Angular material option, which provides additional settings for filtering, sorting, pagination, selection, reordering columns, and more.

### Code Editing
Templer provides an in-built JSON code editor where you can add or remove key-value pairs, and generate data such as Boolean, number, and string. 

## How to Use
The website is divided into two main sections: Excel to JSON conversion and code generation, and a beta layout designer (flexbox and grid). You can use these tools to streamline your front-end development workflow.
